      <h3> An overview of Japan's (lacking) cybersecurity capabilities and why you should care </h3>

        <p> If there is one example of inept leadership cybersecurity leadership industry professionals point to, it is most likely the cyber chief of Japan who (in)famously claimed he did not use a laptop. </p> <br> 
        <p> The cyber chief, Yoshitaka Sakurada, fumbled when asked about USB drives and rudimentary aspects of computing. He claimed he has delegated tasks onto subordinates and therefore was not familiar with the very world he was leading. Not a good look-- especially leading to the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games. </p> <br>  
        <p> If the cyber chief is poorly versed in his own profession, what does this mean for the overall maturity of Japan's cybersecurity model? Of course, this varies based on company (where some, such as Nintendo, are still lacking despite their international presence with the breach of over 200,000 Nintendo accounts during 2020, for example), the national government's policy and position can help inform how mature its strategy is. </p> <br> 
        <p> I have been studying international security with a heavy emphasis on Japan and concerns in the Indo-Pacific and can nearly recite Article 9 of the Constitution (which renounces war potential as a sovereign right of the nation), the hesitancy towards arming Japan could hardly explain why its cybersecurity potential is sorely lacking compared to peers such as Australia. </p> <br>
        <p> While this blog will not focus exclusively on Japan, I'd like to highlight my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VCbuYxWxFnbNc2F_eALmGSWaUuP040mrI2Hyx6yvkck/edit?usp=sharing">past work</a> to illustrate that, despite the low maturity of Japan's national cybersecurity strategy, Japan leverages international diplomacy in the sphere of internet governance. </p>

      <h2> About the page </h2> 
        <p> I created this page to highlight currrent developments in cybersecurity and my humble insights as an aspiring professional and graduate of an international studies program where I focused on law and policy in East Asia. </p> <br>
        <p> Through weekly blogs that range from book reviews of current literature to threat models of ongoing case studies, I aspire to document my learning while sharing my unique insight from a social science background. </p> <br> 
        <p> I chose to call this blog "Crow's Cable" because I <em>adore</em> crows and admire how they were able to seamlessly integrate into the human-made landscape -- whether it be urban or rural. </p> <br> 
        <p> Like the crow, my goal is to write and reflect alongside infosec professionals to better understand the landscape of the world I aspire to dive into. </p>
