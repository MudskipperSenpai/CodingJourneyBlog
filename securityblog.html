      <h2> About the page </h2> 
        <p> I created this page to highlight currrent developments in cybersecurity and my humble insights as an aspiring professional and graduate of an international studies program where I focused on law and policy in East Asia. </p> <br>
        <p> Through weekly blogs that range from book reviews of current literature to threat models of ongoing case studies, I aspire to document my learning while sharing my unique insight from a social science background. </p> <br> 
        <p> I chose to call this blog "Crow's Cable" because I <em>adore</em> crows and admire how they were able to seamlessly integrate into the human-made landscape -- whether it be urban or rural. </p> <br> 
        <p> Like the crow, my goal is to write and reflect alongside infosec professionals to better understand the landscape of the world I aspire to dive into. </p>
